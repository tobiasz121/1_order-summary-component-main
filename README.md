## Overview

This was my first try to build a site using HTML5 and CSS. Transition from pure theory to practice was challenging, but I got more comfortable the more I got into 
the project.

### The challenge

- Centering element horizontally and vertically was challenging.
- Learned and started using flexbox which is really useful, after overcoming first struggles of course.


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
